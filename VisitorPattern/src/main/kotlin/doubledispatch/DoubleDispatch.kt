/**
 * Even if we call this function with a Circle(), it will still call the export(shape: Shape).
 * This happens because the compiler canâ€™t guarantee at the runtime that a respective overloaded
 * method exists in Exporter class. So, at compile time, it binds the export(shape: Shape) version
 * of the method even to the export(Circle()) call because it can verify at the compile-time that
 * at least the Shape version of the method exists. If the Shape version doesn't exist it flags an
 * error that the function cannot be called with the supplied argument. You can check this by
 * commenting the Shape version of the method. This is the case with overloaded methods. But things
 * are different for overridden methods. For overridden methods, the binding is done at runtime
 * depending on the type of the object that exists in the vtable.

 *
 * If overloads also were selected at runtime based on the parameter types, then we wouldn't need
 * this pattern.
